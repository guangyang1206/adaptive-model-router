# Development Workflow — Adaptive Model Router

This document defines how the project is developed, reviewed, and synced to GitHub.
It is tuned to industry best practices for small open-source projects: a protected
`main`, automation that only proposes changes via branches, hard quality gates before
every commit, and human review at milestones.

---

## 1. Principles (non-negotiable)

1. **`main` is sacred.** Automation never pushes directly to `main`. All automated work
   lands on the `develop` branch and is merged only after human review.
2. **Quality gate before every commit.** `build → test → smoke` must all pass. If any
   step fails, the loop writes a diagnostic note and pushes nothing.
3. **Small, reviewable increments.** Each 6-hour cycle advances at most one roadmap
   item. No large unreviewed batches.
4. **Spec/PRD is the source of truth.** Every cycle starts by re-aligning against the
   spec and roadmap, not by inventing scope.
5. **Traceable decisions.** Each cycle appends a short log entry to
   `.workbuddy/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (decisions, what shipped, what's blocked).

## 2. Branch & sync model

```
main            ← protected; only human-reviewed SQUASH merges (1 commit / PR)
  └── develop  ← automation commits here incrementally, then pushes
        └── PR  ← opened at milestones for human review → squash-merge to main
```

- Automation works on `develop`, rebasing on `main` at the start of each cycle.
- Automation **pushes `develop`** every successful cycle (incremental commits are fine —
  they get squashed at merge time; see §3.5).
- Automation **may open or update a PR** `develop → main` via the GitHub API
  (fine-grained PAT stored at `~/.workbuddy/secrets/github_token_adaptive-model-router.env`,
  Pull Requests: write). **It must never merge.** Merging `main` stays a **human action** —
  that is the gate.

**Branch protection on `main` (enforced via API, 2026-06-30):**
- Required status checks (must pass before merge): `pr-title`, `build-test` — `strict=true`
  (PR branch must be up to date with `main`).
- `required_linear_history=true`, `allow_force_pushes=false`, `allow_deletions=false`,
  `required_conversation_resolution=true`.
- `enforce_admins=false` and **no** required reviews — deliberate for a solo-maintainer +
  automation repo: the maintainer can still merge/hotfix, but every **external** PR is hard-gated
  by green CI. (When more maintainers join, flip on required reviews + `enforce_admins`.)

## 3. The 6-hour cycle (what the automation does each run)

| Step | Action | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Align | Read `adaptive-model-router-spec-v0.1.md` + `ROADMAP.md`; compare against current code. Identify the single highest-value next item. | — |
| 2. Sync | `git checkout develop` (create if missing), rebase onto latest `main`. | clean rebase |
| 3. Develop | Implement that one item. Keep diffs focused. | — |
| 4. Lint | `eslint "packages/**/*.ts"`. | must pass |
| 5. Typecheck | `tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json` (noEmit, all package src). | must pass |
| 6. Build | `tsc` build for sdk → dashboard → cli. | must pass |
| 7. Test | `node --test packages/sdk/test/*.mjs`. | must pass |
| 8. Smoke | CLI smoke (init/doctor/inspect/export) + dashboard smoke (boot + `/api/metrics/summary` + `/requests`). | must pass |
| 9. Commit | Conventional commit on `develop`. | only if 4–8 green |
| 10. Push | `git push origin develop`. | — |
| 11. Log | Append cycle summary to `.workbuddy/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. | always |

**If any gate fails:** stop, write the failure + root cause to the daily log, push
nothing. Never commit red code.

### Lint / typecheck / build / test / smoke commands

```bash
TSC=/Users/yangguang/.workbuddy/binaries/node/workspace/node_modules/.bin/tsc
NODE=/Users/yangguang/.workbuddy/binaries/node/versions/20.18.0/bin/node

$NODE node_modules/.bin/eslint "packages/**/*.ts"
$TSC -p tsconfig.typecheck.json
$TSC -p packages/sdk/tsconfig.json
$TSC -p packages/dashboard/tsconfig.json
$TSC -p packages/cli/tsconfig.json
$NODE --test packages/sdk/test/*.mjs
```

(Managed `tsc` + Node's built-in test runner are used instead of `pnpm`, which fails
in this environment due to Corepack signature issues — see `.learnings/ERRORS.md`.)

## 3.5 Commit & merge policy (locked)

We optimize for a **clean, linear `main` where every commit is one reviewable change** —
without forcing the automation to rewrite history.

**Rules:**

1. **One PR = one logical change.** Not "one commit" — one *purpose*. Unrelated changes
   go in separate PRs.
2. **Squash-merge only.** `main` receives exactly **one commit per PR**. Merge-commits and
   rebase-merges are disabled at the repo level; the source branch is auto-deleted on merge.
   → Working branches (`develop`, feature branches) may contain many small commits; GitHub
   collapses them into one on merge. The automation therefore **never** rewrites history.
3. **PR title = Conventional Commit.** The PR title becomes the squash commit message on
   `main`, so it must follow:

   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   type ∈ feat | fix | docs | refactor | test | chore | ci | perf
   scope ∈ sdk | dashboard | cli | storage | docs | ci | repo   (optional)
   ```

   Examples: `feat(sdk): add Gemini provider adapter`, `fix(cli): redact secrets in inspect`.
   This keeps `main` semver/changelog-ready for later automated releases.

**Why squash-merge instead of "rebase the branch to one commit":** the 6-hour loop commits
incrementally and pushes every green cycle. Rebasing `develop` down to a single commit each
time means rewriting pushed history on an unattended branch — fragile and easy to corrupt.
Squash-merge gives the same clean `main` while letting the loop append commits safely.

Repo merge settings (enforced via API, 2026-06-29):
`allow_squash_merge=true`, `allow_merge_commit=false`, `allow_rebase_merge=false`,
`delete_branch_on_merge=true`, `squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE`,
`squash_merge_commit_message=PR_BODY`.

**Enforcement (not just docs):** the `pr-title` CI job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
validates the PR title against the Conventional Commit format on every PR (open/edit/
reopen/sync) — a malformed title fails CI rather than relying on reviewer discipline. We
lint the **title only**, not individual commits, so contributors can use messy WIP commits
freely. Contributor-facing guidance lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## 4. Milestone review (human gate)

At each roadmap milestone (or when `develop` has accumulated a meaningful feature):

1. The loop (or maintainer) opens/updates a PR `develop → main` via the GitHub API.
2. Maintainer reviews the `develop` diff.
3. Runs a code review pass: correctness, scope-vs-spec, test coverage, security
   (no secrets, no unsafe `Function`/eval beyond the documented `node:sqlite` loader).
4. Merge or request changes.
5. Tag a release if it's a roadmap milestone boundary.

---

## 5. Current target scope (as of 2026-06-29)

MVP-0 is **functionally complete** (SDK, quality-gated routing, 4 providers, fallback,
SQLite+JSONL storage, 2-page dashboard, bilingual docs). The dev loop's near-term
objectives are therefore **MVP-1 + quality hardening**, in priority order:

1. ~~**Quality gate completion** — add an eslint config + a `lint` step the CI actually runs.~~ — ✅ done (`9de8f29` on develop): eslint flat config + CI lint step; caught and fixed 3 unused-import issues.
2. **Fix known correctness/clarity debts**
   - ~~`router.dashboard()` returns a URL without starting a server~~ — ✅ fixed (3df0f47): now returns an honest `DashboardHandle { url, started:false, hint }`.
   - ~~`redactConfig()` in CLI is a no-op~~ — ✅ fixed (3df0f47): real recursive secret redaction.
   - ~~token/cost estimation measured stringified-length, not content length~~ — ✅ fixed (dbc078a).
3. **Provider expansion (MVP-1)** — Gemini adapter, Qwen adapter, vLLM support.
4. **Framework adapters** — LangChain/LangGraph, Vercel AI SDK.
5. **Dashboard filtering + model comparison.**

Anything outside the spec's locked scope requires a spec change first — do not let the
loop silently expand scope.
